Welcome to the Steered_Project wiki!

We have a number of scripts to complete-

-Webpage query handler -Links certain genes and info to the webpage

-User generated data display with graphical output -Potentially by the Shiny R module, but will need to be generated on the fly

-We will also need to begin the creation of the webpage

-Link from the page to the UCSC browser for visualisation of all mapped data

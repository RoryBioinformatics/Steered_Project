# Steered_Project
Steered Research Project for Bioinformatics 2016

Welcome to the Steered_Project wiki!

With the majority of the scripting/coding completed, we will need to upload a number of files to the bioinf.bioc server and test the ability of the server to function correctly. The uploaded files will need to be arranged as such-

HTML directory-

              -index.html 
              
              -about.html
              
              -mapping.html
              
              -style1.css
            
              -.bam files (control and test, merged if possible, singular chosen candidates if not)
              
              -.bam.bai files (control and test)
              
              -rn6 cuffdiff output directory-
              
                                            -cuffdiff output
                                            
                                            -SQLite DB
                                            
              -images directory-
              
                                -background images for the stylesheet
                                
                                -whole gene set images (volcano plot etc)
                                
CGI directory-

             -Map2.cgi
             
             
             
The links to the shiny server are already prepared within the html and cgi documents, which will not need any additional files on the web server.

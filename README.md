# Steered_Project
Steered Research Project for Bioinformatics 2016


Welcome to the Steered_Project wiki!

We have a number of scripts to complete-

-Cufflinks/SQLDB linker

-Webpage/DB linker -Has to be able to display the whole DB on a given page

-Webpage query handler -Links certain genes and info to the webpage

-DB/R linker -Acts to generate a specific image based upon the called-for gene.

-User generated data display with graphical output -Potentially by the Shiny R module, but will need to be generated on the fly

We will also need to begin the creation of the webpage and a link from the page to the UCSC browser for visualisation of all mapped data, but this can be delayed for now.

I'm not sure what else to put here.
